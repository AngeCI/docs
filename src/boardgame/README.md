# Web Boardgame Library Collection 
The aim of this project is to create libraries as lightweight and portable as possible for various boardgames. See the demo on [this site](https://angeci.github.io/boardgame/).

The libraries are targeted to be suitable for:
- Provide functions as detailed as possible, such as game replay and analysis
- Widgets embedded into various webpages
- Bundling into standalone apps (via frameworks like Tauri and Electron)
